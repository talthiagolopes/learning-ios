# Learning iOS
I am learning iOS folks =)

There are some references below that were provided to start the projects in order to help the students to be focused on the specific topics.

Please, be free to take a look at the implementations that I have been done based on these projects.

There are also some Swift deep dive that could be useful, click [here](swift-deep-dive) or go to the swift-deep-dive directory.

Are you looking for some Swift UI projects? It is possible to find [here](SwiftUI) or go to the SwiftUI directory.

If you are interested in making some suggestions or also an implementation, it is super welcome ❤️ I will really appreciate it.
