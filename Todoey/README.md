## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to understand how to save data in iOS. We'll look at various choices and learn to use UserDefaults, Core Data and Realm.

### Splitting the goal up
I have decided splitting it up in order to be easier review the implementation that has been improved. In this one is possible to check the UserDefaults and Codable solutions.

UserDefaults: It is used for quickly persist small bits of data. E.g.: top score, player nickname, etc

Codable: It is flash freeze custom objects. E.g.: Array of Item with two properties such as title and selected, etc.


## What you will create

A todolist app to keep track of all your tasks.
