# Extensions

Extensions add new functionality to an existing class, structure, enumeration, or protocol type. This includes the ability to extend types for which you donâ€™t have access to the original source code (known as retroactive modeling)

```bash

import UIKit

protocol CanFly {
    func fly()
}

extension CanFly {
    func fly() {
        print("Amazing! We can have a default implementation and make it doesn't required!")
    }
}

class Eagle: CanFly {
    func soar() {
        print("The eagle glides in the air using air currents.")
    }
}

struct Airplane: CanFly {
    func fly() {
        print("The airplane uses its engine to lift off into the air.")
    }
}

let eagle = Eagle()
eagle.soar() #The eagle glides in the air using air currents.
eagle.fly()  #Amazing! We can have a default implementation and make it doesn't required!

let airplane = Airplane()
airplane.fly() #The airplane uses its engine to lift off into the air.
