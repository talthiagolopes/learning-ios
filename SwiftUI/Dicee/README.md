# Dicee

The Dicee project was created based on the hands on course, there are two amazing stuffs that I learned coding this project.   
The first one is about the `Spacer()`, it means that you have a flexible space that expands along the major axis of its containing stack layout, or on both axes if not contained in a stack.  
The second one is about the `@State`, it is a property wrapper type that can read and write a value managed by SwiftUI.
