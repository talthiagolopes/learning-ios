# H1N1 - H@ck$r News

  

The H1N1 project was created based on the hands on course, there are many amazing stuffs that I learned coding this project. 

1. New components such as NavigationView, NavigationLink, List, UIViewRepresentable, and WKWebView
2. Splitting up some new views with Swift UI
3. Managing state using ObservableObject, @ObservedObject and @Published

The interesting thing about this particularly project, it is outdated project, but nowadays the base structure still working for the new versions. However I realised some new improvements.
