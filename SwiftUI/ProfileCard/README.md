# Profile Card

The Profile Card project was created based on the hands on course. I have been exploring different components and properties with Swift UI and also spliting out the component in own file. Another cool thing was about adding a specific font from Google and reviewing the challenge with Light and Dark mode on iOS device.

Fonts from Google: https://fonts.google.com  
Colour Palettes; https://flatuicolors.com  
Convert HEX & RGB colors to UIColor: https://www.uicolor.io  
Apple's SF Symbols: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols  
SF Symbols 5, it is possible to install the app on MacOS: https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/  

## The evidence is taken from Iphone 8 and iOS 16.6 version
