# Swift UI
I am learning Swift UI folks =)

This swift UI directory has been created in order to organize this module in this nice course that I am learning iOS + Swift.

First of all, I would like to share some feelings that I have got working with Swift UI. To be honest I really love it! Sounds preety interesting and powerful.

The idea is keep learning more with a specific course after get this current one finished. I will probably create a reference here _TODO// Should be creating a link reference here_ to be easier to go there. 

If you are interested in making some suggestions or also an implementation, it is super welcome ❤️ I will really appreciate it.
