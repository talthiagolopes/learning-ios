# Todoey Core Data âœ“

## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to understand how to save data in iOS. We'll look at various choices and learn to use UserDefaults, Core Data and Realm.

### Splitting the goal up - Core Data
I have decided splitting it up in order to be easier review the implementation that has been improved. In this one is possible to check the Core Data solution.

Core Data overview: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/\

NSPredicate: https://nshipster.com/nspredicate/

Property observers (e.g. didSet): https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/properties/#Property-Observers


## What you will create

A todolist app to keep track of all your tasks.
